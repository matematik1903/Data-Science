🍲 I carry out the project "What's Cooking?".🌶

🔻 If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens🥬, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard.🍑
🔻 Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you,🥘 while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby.🍤
🔻 India’s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices:🍜 turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.🧂🍛

🔸 This repository will contain data, work files, detailed analysis of the task.
🔸 Here will be shown the work of various models of machine learning.🤖
